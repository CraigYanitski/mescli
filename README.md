# MESCLI
---

MESCLI is a CLI messaging app.
I want secure end-to-end encryption of the messages, as well as a double ratchet for improved security.
There will preferably be markup support, including a maths mode.
It is not yet known whether a server will be made public.
More likely than not, this will have iterations over several stages.
